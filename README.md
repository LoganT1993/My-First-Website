# My-First-Website
AppAcademy assignment.

This website was designed to be the first of a series of capstone projects that I'll work on as I progress through the course. The site is deliberately simple by design and includes what needed to be included, plus some extra things that I felt like working on. Future endeavors will be more ambitious as I learn more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to really make my website pop.
